#summary How to build a distibution (Windows-32 bit)

=Build guide - Windows=
 # Install Python 2.6/7 (32 bit)
 # Install PyQt (>=4.8.X recomended)
 # Install cx_freeze (If you want to use the included build_spec.py)
 # Copy the hooks.py file from .\extra to your cx_freeze install in site-packages. Overwrite the existing one (Make a backup if need be). The custom one I use excludes some of the specific packages that are added by cx_freeze for PyQt4 in the interest of build size.
 # Run .\extra\build.bat to compile
 
 That should be it, if there are any ommisions, please let me know.
